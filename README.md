Given the confidence intervals for the intercept and coefficient, is it True or False that Disney studios should make more action and adventure movies?

1.	This project analyzes a dataset of Disney movies to understand what contributes to the success of Disney movies
2.	The data contains information about 579 Disney movies, including the movie title, release date, genre, MPAA rating, total gross, and inflation-adjusted gross
3.	The top 10 Disney movies with the highest adjusted gross were identified
4.	The trend of movie genres was analyzed by grouping movies by genre and year to see the adjusted gross of each genre in each year
5.	A line plot was made to visualize the genre popularity trend and showed that the action and adventure genres are growing the fastest
6.	A linear regression model was built to understand the relationship between genre and box office gross, using one-hot encoding to convert the categorical genre variable to numerical data
7.	The coefficients from the regression model were used to determine the impact of the action and adventure genres on the adjusted gross
8.	95% confidence intervals were calculated for the intercept and coefficients using the pairs bootstrap method
9.	The results showed that the adjusted gross is significantly correlated with the action and adventure genres, based on the confidence intervals that do not contain 0
10.	The project concluded that Disney movies with plots that fit into the action and adventure genre tend to perform better in terms of adjusted gross, and more of these types of movies could be expected in the future.
